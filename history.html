    <p>A24 is an American independent film distributor that has made its name as a top indie film house known for its authentic, intelligent, and aesthetically pleasing films. Founded on August 20, 2012 by film veterans Daniel Katz, David Fenkel, and John Hodges, A24 quickly became a champion in distribution. A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III, A24’s first official theatrical release, laid the foundation for small, artistic films that attract a particular audience.
    </p>
    <p>From there, the company started becoming a hot topic in the film industry after distributing Spring Breakers, The Bling Ring, and The Spectacular Now in 2013. It’s a rare occurrence that a distribution company receives recognition; therefore, A24’s ability to draw attention to itself within the film industry. With its distinct aesthetic, notable actors, and indie plot lines, A24 has set itself apart and is becoming a household name.
    </p>
    <p>Despite being relatively young, A24 secured its spot in the competitive industry. As of October 2020, the company has released over 100 movies, many of which have been nominated for hundreds of awards. In 2016, Moonlight took home the award for Best Picture Oscar and Best Adapted Screenplay, further solidifying A24’s position in the industry. As A24 continues to put out more films that push powerful and captivating narratives, the culture and fanbase will continue to grow.
